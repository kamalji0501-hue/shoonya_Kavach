## Locked / skipped (Q79–Q98) — 2026-07-15

| # | Answer | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| Q79 | **A** | Retrace SELL = registered ATO lots only; never sell excess manual qty |
| Q80 | **A** | Partial manual ignored (Q73) + breach on → BUY remainder book-first |
| Q81 | **A** | Exact manual buy = adopt holding / exit-only; no second BUY on breach |
| Q82 | **A** | Add lots while holding → ignore excess; exit scope stays registered |
| Q83 | **C** | Quick Tune = **buffers only** in v1; lots/strikes still need Complete → register |
| Q84 | **A** | Quick Tune v1 = buffers only (entry + exit), both sides |
| Q85 | **A** | Quick Tune while holding allowed; new buffer applies next tick |
| Q86 | **skipped** | N/A Quick Tune v1 (Q83 C / Q84 A); revisit if Complete mid-hold lot ↑ |
| Q87 | **A** | Lots ↓ while holding → registered smaller; ignore broker excess (Q72) |
| Q88 | **skipped** | N/A Quick Tune v1 (buffers only); strikes stay Complete → register |
| Q89 | **A** | Entry buffer while holding: recalc only; new buffer → next cycle after retrace |
| Q90 | **C** | Invoke via `/ato_tune` **and** `/ato_status` buttons |
| Q91 | **A** | Menu label = **ATO Configuration** |
| Q92 | **C** | Side pick: Both → CE only | PE only | both | Cancel |
| Q93 | **A** | Every step: current value + **[ Keep current ]** |
| Q94 | **C** | v1 order = **Entry → Exit** (buffers only; no strike/lots in Quick Tune) |
| Q95 | **C** | Confirm = summary + **warnings** + Apply |
| Q96 | **C** | Strike UI (future/Complete): register keyboards + **highlight current** |
| Q97 | **A** | Both sides: all CE then all PE → one summary |
| Q98 | **B** | Not armed: tap → “Register first” + point to `/register` |

## Locked answers (Q71–Q78)

| # | Answer | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| Q71 | **A** | 15:15 IST → stop monitoring only; open legs stay on Dhan *(recommended — not explicitly stated)* |
| Q72 | **A** | 26A manual buy **more** lots → algo scope = **registered ATO lots only**; warn excess outside scope |
| Q73 | **C** | 26A manual buy **fewer** lots → **ignore** partial manual; at breach BUY **registered** lots (book-first) |
| Q74 | **A** | Side halt stays until operator `/resume` — book self-heal does not auto-clear |
| Q75 | **A** | Resume clears global pause **and** resumable side halt(s); re-evaluate (Q55) |
| Q76 | **A** | Do not count soft-cap breaches while paused / not monitoring |
| Q77 | **A** | Allow Batman Complete while paused / side halted |
| Q78 | **A** | One side order-fail → halt that side only; other side continues (Q28) |

| Q62 | **Custom** | Position read: **retry up to 3×** per poll; still unreadable → pause ALL + JAGRAN; recovery on retry → JAGRAN info alert, **continue** (no manual Resume for transient blip) |

## QUESTION #47

**Area:**  
Batman qty drift vs retrace exit

**Scenario:**  
CE side armed. Operator manually closes part of a **Batman** leg (not protect) on Dhan. Broker qty < managed qty. Side halts. Spot later retraces — should KAVACH still SELL the protect leg?

**Options:**  
A. Halt blocks everything on that side — no retrace until Complete → re-register  
B. Halt blocks new BUY only — retrace SELL still allowed if protect leg is open  
C. Halt blocks retrace too — but auto-clear halt once broker qty matches managed again  
D. Custom  

**Recommended:**  
A *(aligns with Q41)*

**Operator answer:** **A**

---

## QUESTION #48

**Area:**  
Order placement / book validation

**Scenario:**  
ATO BUY fires. Dhan accepts order but local book shows 0 qty for 1–2 poll ticks (lag). Current code retries up to 3× immediately.

**Options:**  
A. Keep 3 fast retries — idempotency prevents duplicates  
B. Add short settle wait (e.g. 1–2 s) between retries before re-ordering  
C. Trust order ID on success if book is None/unreadable; retry only on explicit mismatch  
D. Custom  

**Recommended:**  
A for Phase 1 *(Q8/Q12 locked: book-first + 3 retries)*

**Operator answer:** **A**

---

## QUESTION #49

**Area:**  
SARANSH economy profile tag

**Scenario:**  
Operator uses CE preset **+1000** (far OTM) with ATO lots = 1. Economy chop test — should SARANSH show **Custom ATO / economy profile**?

**Options:**  
A. Tag **custom protect only** (typed strike) — presets are “normal”  
B. Tag **any** far-from-auto protect (preset +500/+1000/−500 or custom)  
C. Tag when ATO lots < managed lots **or** custom strike **or** preset offset ≥ 500  
D. Custom  

**Recommended:**  
C *(Q25 intent — economy = cheap chop test, not only free-text custom)*

**Operator answer:** **A** — keep SARANSH simple; custom typed strike only

---

## QUESTION #50

**Area:**  
Manual leg — wrong strike / stray positions (26C)

**Scenario:**  
Armed for protect 26,000 CE. Operator manually buys 26,500 CE on Dhan (wrong strike) or other directional legs. Algo idle on CE.

**Options:**  
A. Pause **CE side** + warn + JAGRAN — ignore wrong leg; never touch it

C. Warn only — keep monitoring registered strike  
D. Custom  

**Recommended:**  
A *(was locked as **26C** — superseded by operator 2026-06-21)*

**Operator answer:** **C+** — **no special action**; ignore background noise; monitor registered protect only; operator handles stray legs manually

---

## QUESTION #51

**Area:**  
Manual leg — full exit while holding (26D / 31)

**Scenario:**  
ATO active (holding 2 lots 26,000 CE). Operator manually SELLs all 2 lots on Dhan. Algo still thinks `ce_triggered=True`.

**Options:**  
A. Pause **that side** + warn — operator must Resume or Complete  
B. Auto-adopt flat book → reset triggered=False; continue monitoring  
C. Pause side + auto-reset flags when book shows 0 protect qty  
D. Custom  

**Recommended:**  
A *(locked as **26D** / **31** in §7)*

**Operator answer:** **A**

---

## QUESTION #52

**Area:**  
Resume after wrong-strike pause (34A)

**Options:**  
A. Resume monitoring **registered protect only** — warn; never touch wrong leg  
B. Block Resume until wrong leg closed manually  
C. Resume + attempt to close wrong leg automatically  
D. Custom  

**Recommended:**  
A *(locked as **34A** in §7)*

**Operator answer:** **A** *(applies when side paused for other reasons; Q50 wrong-strike does not pause)*

---

## QUESTION #53

**Area:**  
Position book unreadable (Q33)

**Scenario:**  
`get_positions()` fails or returns unreadable during breach check. CE side was about to fire.

**Options:**

C. Skip one tick; retry next poll — pause only after N consecutive failures  
D. Custom  

**Recommended:**  
A *(locked as Q33)*

**Operator answer:** **A**

---

## QUESTION #54

**Area:**  
Implementation priority (next coding chunk)

B. Block Complete until all halts cleared and algo running  
C. Allow Complete but **block** auto-wizard until manual `/resume` once  
D. Custom  

**Recommended:**  
A *(Complete is lifecycle; Q24 path should always work)*

**Operator answer:** **A**

---

## QUESTION #78

**Area:**  
**Both sides breach** same poll — CE order path fails

**Scenario:**  
CE and PE breach on same tick. CE BUY fails after 3 retries → CE side halt + JAGRAN. PE BUY succeeds and is holding.

**Options:**  
A. **CE halted, PE continues** independently (Q28) — no global pause  
B. **Pause ALL** ATO if either side order-fails  
C. Pause ALL only if **both** sides fail  
D. Custom  

**Recommended:**

Registered ATO = **2 lots**. You manually bought **3 lots** at correct protect (26A adopt). Spot retraces. Broker shows 195 qty.

**Options:**  
A. SELL **registered 2 lots only** (130 qty); warn — **never** SELL the extra 65  
B. SELL full broker 195 qty  
C. Pause side — operator must reduce book to registered size first

26A **ignore partial** (Q73 C) + breach **already on**

**Scenario:**  
Registered ATO = **2 lots**. You manually buy **1 lot** at correct strike (ignored per Q73). Spot is **already breached** (above CE sell + buffer).

**Options:**  
A. On next eval: if registered protect **not fully** at broker → **BUY remainder** (1 lot) per book-first; ignore the manual 1 lot as “already there” for qty math  
B. SELL the manual 1 lot first, then BUY 2 fresh lots  
C. Pause side — operator must fix book manually  
D. Custom  

**Recommended:**  
A *(book-first: need 130 total for registered scope; 65 present → buy 65 more)*

**Operator answer:** **A** (2026-07-15)

## QUESTION #82

**Area:**  
**Holding** (algo active) — operator **adds** lots on Dhan above registered

**Scenario:**  
Algo holding 2 lots (130). You manually buy **1 more lot** on Dhan (195 total). Registered ATO still 2 lots.

**Options:**  
A. **Ignore** extra lot — retrace SELL **registered 2 lots only** (Q60); warn excess on book  
B. Adopt 3 lots — algo now manages 195  
C. Pause CE side until book back to 130  
D. Custom  

**Recommended:**  
A *(same principle as Q72 — registered scope only)*

**Operator answer:** **A** (2026-07-15)

**Options:**  
A. **Quick Tune** — patch deployment; **no** Complete; short confirm  
B. Still **Complete → full register** for any mid-week change (keep Q24)  
C. Quick Tune for **buffers only**; lots/strikes still need Complete → register  
D. Custom  

**Operator answer:** **C** (2026-07-15) — Quick Tune buffers only in Phase 1 v1; lots/strikes need Complete → register

---
