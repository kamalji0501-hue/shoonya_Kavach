# LAKSHMI (लक्ष्मी) — Detailed Design
## Bot 3 | MTM Alerts, Profit Targets, P&L Reporting
## Design Doc | Status: DESIGN PENDING — params defined, behaviour not yet designed

---

## Role

LAKSHMI is the **P&L and alert bot**. It watches the live MTM (mark-to-market) value of Batman positions and alerts Rahul when loss thresholds are hit, when profit targets are reached, and sends an end-of-day P&L summary.

> **Process model (LOCKED 2026-04-04):** LAKSHMI runs as an asyncio task inside a single `python main.py` process on the VPS, alongside DRISHTI, KAVACH, and all algo modules.

> **`/pnl` is exclusively LAKSHMI's command.** KAVACH does not implement `/pnl`. Modular design: each bot owns one domain. Rahul sends `/pnl` to the LAKSHMI bot to get a live P&L snapshot at any moment, even while ATO is running in the background.
