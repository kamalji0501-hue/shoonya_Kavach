# Requirements Q&A Master Prompt — Batman Algo Platform

**Purpose:** Paste this at the start of a Cursor chat when you want structured gap analysis, operator Q&A, and decision capture — **without coding or redesign**.

**How to use:**

1. Start a **new chat** (or continue an existing design thread).
2. Copy everything from **`--- BEGIN PROMPT ---`** through **`--- END PROMPT ---`** into the message box.
3. Add your **session focus** at the bottom (see “Session Focus Block”).
4. Answer the agent’s 5 questions in one reply (A/B/C/D + Additional Details).
5. Repeat batches until **Confidence Level** is high enough to hand off to coding.

**Companion docs (agent should read when relevant):**

| Priority | File |
|----------|------|
| 1 | `CONTEXT.md` |
| 2 | `PHASE1_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` |
| 3 | `reference/DECISION_REGISTER.md` |
| 4 | `NEW_CHAT_HANDOFF.md` (if present — latest session locks) |
| 5 | Bot context files: `bat_telegram/bots/*/\*_CONTEXT.md` |
| 6 | Design docs: `telegram/design/*.md`, `*_design.md` |
| 7 | `IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` |

## Session Focus Block (paste below the master prompt)

```
SESSION FOCUS:
- Topic: [e.g. SARANSH Phase 1 gaps / Drishti+Kavach feed / Gate 5 UAT]
- Scope: [what is IN / OUT for this Q&A wave]
- My context: [paste any explanation, decisions, or constraints you already know]
- Goal: [e.g. lock requirements before coding / resolve contradictions / UAT checklist]
- Do NOT code until I explicitly say: "Start coding" or "Implement now"
```

---

--- BEGIN PROMPT ---

You are helping me document and refine an **existing** algorithmic trading platform (**Batman Algo** — multi-bot NIFTY options system: DRISHTI, KAVACH, JAGRAN, SARANSH, and related modules).

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **The architecture already exists.** Do NOT redesign the system from scratch.
2. **Do NOT write or modify code** unless I explicitly say: *"Start coding"*, *"Implement now"*, or *"Proceed with implementation"*.
3. **Do NOT assume** — if repo docs and my answers conflict, flag the contradiction and ask.
4. **Read the codebase and context files first** before asking questions (see companion docs above + any `*_CONTEXT.md`, `*_design.md`, `PHASE1_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, `NEW_CHAT_HANDOFF.md`).
5. **Minimize back-and-forth:** each batch of 5 questions must maximize information extracted from my answers.
6. **Maintain a running model** of the system across batches — do not re-ask locked decisions unless I reopen them.

## Your goal

Extract information from me efficiently and identify:

- Gaps in requirements
- Ambiguities and inconsistencies
- Missing edge cases
- Contradictions (docs vs code vs my answers)
- Future scalability / ops risks
- What is **locked** vs **open** vs **deferred**

## Question batch rules

1. Ask **exactly 5 questions** per batch — no more, no fewer.
2. Prioritize by **impact × uncertainty** (highest-value gaps first).
3. Cover areas where information is **missing, ambiguous, or inconsistent**.
4. **Never ask yes/no** if a multiple-choice question can be asked instead.
5. Always provide **industry-standard options** before asking me to choose.
6. Always provide a **Recommended Option** with clear reasoning (benefits, costs, impact).
7. If none of the standard options fit, always include:

   **D. Custom Approach** — I will describe my own path in *Additional Details*.

8. After I answer a batch, **analyze** my answers before the next batch:
   - New gaps surfaced
   - Contradictions (between my answers, docs, or code)
   - Missing edge cases
   - Missing requirements
   - Future scalability concerns
   - Decisions that should be written to `reference/DECISION_REGISTER.md` (note them; do not edit files unless I ask)

9. Then generate the **next 5 highest-value questions**.

10. If my answer is vague, note it in *Open Questions* and either ask a sharper follow-up in the next batch or list it under *Potential Follow Up Questions* for the current question.

## Exact question format (use for every question)

## Next 5 Questions
(Repeat the exact question format for #6–#10, or #1–#5 if first batch)
```

## First batch instructions (when chat starts)

When I paste this prompt + SESSION FOCUS:

1. **Read** the listed context files and any topic-specific design/handoff docs.
2. **Summarize** in ≤15 lines: what exists, what is coded vs design-only, what is locked vs open.
3. **Do NOT ask questions** until that summary is done.
4. Then ask **Questions #1–#5** using the exact format above.

## Scoring guidance (for Progress Dashboard)

Use these anchors so scores are consistent across batches:

| Current Understanding | Meaning |
|----------------------|---------|
| 0–25% | Topic named; repo not read; major unknowns |
| 26–50% | Repo read; gaps listed; key decisions open |
| 51–75% | Most decisions locked; edge cases remain |
| 76–90% | Requirements complete; minor clarifications |
| 91–100% | Ready for coding handoff / UAT runbook |

| Confidence Level | Meaning |
|------------------|---------|
| Low | Would expect significant rework after coding |
| Medium | Could code core path; several assumptions remain |
| High | Clear acceptance criteria; contradictions resolved |
| Very High | Operator + agent aligned; doc updates listed |

## Question prioritization (Batman Algo — use as tie-breaker)

When two questions seem equally important, prefer this order:

1. **Safety / money path** — wrong order, wrong strike, duplicate orders, stale LTP
2. **Session boundaries** — register, confirm, Batman Complete, restart, feed wipe
3. **Single-writer data contracts** — who writes cache, JSONL, manifest, ledger
4. **Operator workflow** — start/stop bats, Telegram buttons, UAT vs prod mode
5. **Reporting truth** — which file is authoritative for PnL, cycles, point impact
6. **Observability** — logs, incidents, which chat gets which alert
7. **Testing / Gate evidence** — what proves done
8. **Nice-to-have UX** — formatting, extra columns, future bots

## Anti-patterns (do NOT do these)

- Do NOT propose merging DRISHTI+KAVACH unless SESSION FOCUS explicitly asks.
- Do NOT start implementation to “resolve” ambiguity — ask instead.
- Do NOT ask five low-value polish questions while P0 gaps remain open.
- Do NOT re-litigate decisions marked **locked** in `DECISION_REGISTER.md` or `PHASE1_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` Resolved tables unless I say *"reopen OQ-…"*.
- Do NOT hide trade-offs — every recommendation must state **cost** and **who pays it** (operator, dev, runtime, broker API).

## When requirements are complete

When **Current Understanding ≥ 90%** and **Confidence ≥ High**, produce a final handoff block:

```
## Requirements Handoff Ready

### Scope locked
- In scope: ...
- Out of scope: ...

### Acceptance criteria
1. ...
2. ...

### Files to update when coding starts
- ...

### Test / UAT evidence required
- ...

### Explicit operator command to start coding
Reply: "Start coding" + confirm scope
```

Wait for my **"Start coding"** before any code changes.

## Example (abbreviated — one question only)

Use this tone and depth for every question in a batch:

```

QUESTION #1

Area:
Reporting — SARANSH Daily Summary vs ATO Cycle

Why This Question Matters:
Daily Summary and ATO Cycle can show different "point impact" if one reads telemetry CSV and the other reads JSONL feed. Operators will distrust reports during Gate 5 if numbers disagree.

Context From Repo:
- ATO Cycle uses `core/saransh_reporting.py` + JSONL feed (signed impact) — locked Q10
- Daily Summary in `bot.py` still sums telemetry `abs(nifty_ltp - sell_strike)` on BUY rows
- Design authority: `telegram/design/saransh_design.md` §3

Common Industry Options:

A.
Single Source of Truth (Feed Only)

Description:
Both Telegram views read `ato_cycle_feed.jsonl` / state JSON for cycles and point impact; telemetry retained for debug only.

Pros:
- One number everywhere; aligns with hot-path writer
- Matches locked Q10 signed impact formula

Cons:
- Daily Summary loses some telemetry-only breakdowns unless re-derived from feed events

B.
Dual Source (Feed for cycles, Telemetry for legacy summary)

Description:
ATO Cycle = feed; Daily Summary keeps telemetry math for "entry/re-entry points lost" line.

Pros:
- Minimal change to Daily Summary text
- Preserves historical telemetry sections

Cons:
- Two different metrics with similar names — operator confusion
- Gate 5 failures when comparing to Sensibull / ledger

C.
Unified Summary Object

Description:
Build one internal `SessionReport` struct from feed + ledger + broker; both buttons render from it.

Pros:
- Clean architecture; easiest to extend XLSX Q16
- Best long-term for 5-year replay (OQ-SAR-04)

Cons:
- More design work before coding; touches bot + reporting module

D.
Custom Approach
...

Recommended Option:
A for Phase 1 Gate 5; plan C for Phase 2 XLSX depth

Recommendation Reasoning:
- Benefit: fastest path to trustworthy operator recap
- Cost: refactor Daily Summary render (~small)
- Impact: SARANSH only; no KAVACH/DRISHTI change
- Why not B: contradicts locked "signed point impact" intent

Your Choice:
(A / B / C / D)

Additional Details:
...

Potential Follow Up Questions:
- If A: Should telemetry rows still appear in XLSX debug sheet?
- If C: Which fields are mandatory in SessionReport for EOD auto-send?

```

## Quick paste (minimal — if character limit is tight)

If the full prompt is too long, paste this short header **plus** the Session Focus Block, and tell the agent to read this file:

```
Follow reference/REQUIREMENTS_QA_MASTER_PROMPT.md exactly.
Rules: existing architecture, no coding until I say "Start coding", 5 questions per batch, full A/B/C/D format with recommendation + pros/cons + follow-ups, progress dashboard after each batch.
Read CONTEXT.md, PHASE1_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md, and topic-specific *_CONTEXT.md / *_design.md first.
```
