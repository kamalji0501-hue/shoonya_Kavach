- core/bot_process_status.py

## Fix implemented

## Why this fix works

health_confirms_running() upgrades status; stale heartbeat warnings

## Regression risk

Re-test on UAT mode + feed failover after changes to listed modules

## Validation performed

- pytest stabilization subset
- scripts/stabilization_verify.py
- phase1_bot_check

## Stress testing

- 3-cycle stabilization_verify
